"Solvothermal routes for synthesis of zinc oxide nanorods.. Control of the synthesis of nanomaterials to produce morphologies exhibiting quantized properties will enable device integration of several novel applications including biosensors, catalysis, and optical devices. In this work, solvothermal routes to produce zinc oxide nanorods are explored. Much previous work has relied on the addition of growth directing/inhibiting agents to control morphology. It was found in coarsening studies that zinc oxide nanodots will ripen to nanorod morphologies at temperatures of 90 to 120 C. The resulting nanorods have widths of 9-12 nm average dimension, which is smaller than current methods for nanorod synthesis. Use of nanodots as nuclei may be an approach that will allow for controlled growth of higher aspect ratio nanorods.",not-nuke

"Practical applications of MORT concepts. [Safety programs for research laboratories; management oversight and risk tree (MORT) planning]. Useful concepts from the Management Oversight and Risk Tree (MORT) integrated and planned for inclusion into the safety program of a major research laboratory are discussed. Programs involving infusion of the MORT concepts start with a safety orientation for new and experienced supervisors, a safety inspection guide for first-line supervisors, and modification to other safety documents/programs as the Industrial Safety Manual. Discussion of new programs in development and upgrading of existing programs cover (but are not limited to) areas such as design, information systems, accident investigation and analysis, and hazard analysis and risk assessment.

"A new parallel molecular dynamics algorithm for organic systems. A new parallel algorithm for simulating bonded molecular systems such as polymers and proteins by molecular dynamics (MD) is presented. In contrast to methods that extract parallelism by breaking the spatial domain into sub-pieces, the new method does not require regular geometries or uniform particle densities to achieve high parallel efficiency. For very large, regular systems spatial methods are often the best choice, but in practice the new method is faster for systems with tens-of-thousands of atoms simulated on large numbers of processors. It is also several times faster than the techniques commonly used for parallelizing bonded MD that assign a subset of atoms to each processor and require all-to-all communication. Implementation of the algorithm in a CHARMm-like MD model with many body forces and constraint dynamics is discussed and timings on the Intel Delta and Paragon machines are given. Example calculations using the algorithm in simulations of polymers and liquid-crystal molecules will also be briefly discussed.",not-nuke
"Plasmon-enhanced polymer photovoltaic cells based on large aspect ratio gold nanorods and the related working mechanism. Two types of Au nanorods (NRs) possessing longitudinal/transverse axes of 55/11 (NR{sub 11}) and 90/18 nm (NR{sub 18}) are, respectively, incorporated into the hole extraction layer to improve optical-to-electrical conversion performances in polymer photovoltaic cells. Totally different improvement factors in short-circuit current and power conversion efficiency occur in the NR{sub 11}- and NR{sub 18}-doped cells. Optical simulations, electrical analysis, and morphology alteration accompanying with the incorporation of NRs were proceeded to investigate the reason, and analysis demonstrates that a slower damping of field around NRs{sub 18} (results in a field and absorption enhancement around the active layer) and one order higher scattering cross section in the NR{sub 18}-incorporated cell are key factors contributed to the improvement of cell performances.",not-nuke
"AI approach to optimal var control with fuzzy reactive loads. This paper presents an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to the optimal reactive power (var) control problem. The method incorporates the reactive load uncertainty in optimizing the overall system performance. The artificial neural network (ANN) enhanced by fuzzy sets is used to determine the memberships of control variables corresponding to the given load values. A power flow solution will determine the corresponding state of the system. Since the resulting system state may not be feasible in real-time, a heuristic method based on the application of sensitivities in expert system is employed to refine the solution with minimum adjustments of control variables. Test cases and numerical results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Simplicity, processing speed and ability to model load uncertainties make this approach a viable option for on-line var control.",not-nuke

"First-principles calculation of the cross sections for nuclear excitation by electron capture of channeled nuclei. The time-dependent fields experienced by a nucleus as it passes through a crystal can cause transitions to excited nuclear states. The transition rate is especially large when the speed of the nucleus satisfies a resonance condition. Previous estimates of the nuclear excitation rates have been based on symmetry arguments and experimental data for related processes. We present here a calculation of the nuclear excitation rate which does not rely on these simplifying approximations. Using nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, the excitation cross sections of highly stripped nuclei channeled along the Si[l angle]110[r angle] crystal axis have been calculated. The results are smaller than those given by previous estimates by several orders of magnitude. We note that there are similarly large discrepancies between different theoretical and experimental results for other phenomena involving coupled electronic and nuclear transitions. The reason for these disagreements is not clear.",nuke
"Injection timing control device in a distributor-type fuel injection pump. A distributor-type fuel injection pump is described for an internal combustion engine, comprising: a pump housing: a suction space defined within the pump housing and filled with fuel having a pressure variable as a function of the rotational speed of the engine; a timer piston displaceable in response to a change in the fuel pressure; means for controlling the fuel injection timing of the fuel injection pump in response to displacement of the timer piston; and drain passage means partly formed in the timer piston for permanently communicating the suction space with a zone under a lower pressure, the drain passage means having a restricting portion disposed to restrict the flow rate of fuel flowing therethrough from the suction space to the zone under a lower pressure when the timer piston is positioned within a region corresponding to a particular rotational speed region of the engine.",not-nuke
"'Footballs', conical singularities, and the Liouville equation. We generalize the football shaped extra dimensions scenario to an arbitrary number of branes. The problem is related to the solution of the Liouville equation with singularities, and explicit solutions are presented for the case of three branes. The tensions of the branes do not need to be tuned with each other but only satisfy mild global constraints.",not-nuke
"Theiler's virus RNA and protein synthesis in the central nervous system of demyelinating mice. The authors studied Theiler's virus RNA and capsid protein synthesis in sections of mouse spinal cord using in situ hybridization coupled to immunoperoxidase. They found that the majority of infected cells contain 100 to 500 viral genomes and no detectable capsid antigens. Similarly, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, which are permissive to Theiler's virus, do not synthesize capsid if they contain less than 1000 viral genomes. The results demonstrate that virus multiplication is restricted in vivo at the level of RNA replication. They suggest that RNA restriction is sufficient to explain the lack of capsid antigen synthesis.",not-nuke
"Characterizing system dynamics with a weighted and directed network constructed from time series data. In this work, we propose a novel method to transform a time series into a weighted and directed network. For a given time series, we first generate a set of segments via a sliding window, and then use a doubly symbolic scheme to characterize every windowed segment by combining absolute amplitude information with an ordinal pattern characterization. Based on this construction, a network can be directly constructed from the given time series: segments corresponding to different symbol-pairs are mapped to network nodes and the temporal succession between nodes is represented by directed links. With this conversion, dynamics underlying the time series has been encoded into the network structure. We illustrate the potential of our networks with a well-studied dynamical model as a benchmark example. Results show that network measures for characterizing global properties can detect the dynamical transitions in the underlying system. Moreover, we employ a random walk algorithm to sample loops in our networks, and find that time series with different dynamics exhibits distinct cycle structure. That is, the relative prevalence of loops with different lengths can be used to identify the underlying dynamics.",not-nuke
"Probabilistic bootstrap percolation. In bootstrap percolation, sites are occupied with probability p, but those with less than m occupied first neighbors are removed. This culling process is repeated until a stable configuration (all occupied sites have at least m occupied first neighbors or the who lattice is empty) is achieved. For m [ge] m, the transition is first order, while for m < m it is second order, with m-dependent exponents. In probabilistic bootstrap percolation sites have probability r or (1 - r) of being m- or m[prime]-sites, respectively m-sites are those which need at least Bethe lattices, where an exact solution is available. For m = 2 and m[prime] = 3, the transition changes from second to first order at r[sup 1] = 1/2, and the exponent [beta] is different for r < 1/2, r = 1/2, and r > 1/2. The same qualitative behavior is found for m = 1 and m[prime] = 3. On the other hand, for m = 1 and m[prime] = 2 the transition is always second order, with the same exponents of m = 1, for any value of r > 0. We found, for m = z - 1 and m[prime] = z, where z is the coordination number of the lattice, that p[sub c] = 1 for a value of r which depends on z, but is always above zero. Finally, we argue that, for bootstrap percolation on real lattices, the exponents v and [beta] for m = 2 and m = 1 are equal, for dimensions below 6.",not-nuke
"Infrared study of vibrational property and polymerization of C[sub 60] and C[sub 70] under pressure. Infrared spectra were measured for solid C[sub 60] and C[sub 70] to 7 GPa under hydrostatic or quasi-hydrostatic pressure at room temperature. Some vibrational modes showed negative or insensitive dependence of frequency on pressure, suggesting destabilization of C[sub 60] and C[sub 70] molecules by compression. In solid C[sub 60] new absorption bands gradually grew with increasing pressure in association with an intensity decrease of the original bands. These spectral changes were interpreted in terms of polymerization of C[sub 60] molecules. Polymerized molecules recovered at ambient pressure were converted back to the monomer by thermal annealing at 473 K. 16 refs., 4 figs., 2 tabs.",not-nuke
"Interstitial flow intensification within packed granular bed filters: Experiments and theory. The mechanical collection efficiency of a granular bed filter is determined by the flow within the bed. In spite of the demonstrable sensitivity of existing models to their proposed flow structures, most do not attempt accurate characterization of the flow. In particular, interstitial flow intensification and flow separation are usually neglected. In the present paper an analytic model and collection measurements are combined to examine these effects. A potential flow model is developed in which the magnitude of the flow intensification is characterized by a single ''intensification parameter''. The experimental data are then employed to develop a unique correlation of this parameter with Reynolds number.",not-nuke

"Macroscopic quantum tunneling and energy-level quantization in the zero voltage state of the current-biased Josephson junction. A macroscopic variable, the phase difference across a Josephson junction, is shown to obey quantum mechanics by observing the phenomena of energy-level quantization and quantum tunneling. The relevant parameters of the junction were determined in situ in the thermal regime from the dependence of the escape rate on bias current and from resonant activation in the presence of microwaves. The first observation of quantized energy levels for this system is reported. The positions of these energy levels are in quantitative agreement with the quantum mechanical predictions based on the measured junction parameters. A model is presented that predicts correctly the observed resonance shapes. The measured value of the escape rate out of the zero-voltage state for an underdamped (Q approx. 30) junction was found to be independent of temperature at low temperatures. This low temperature escape rate was in excellent agreement with the prediction for macroscopic quantum tunneling, with no adjustable parameters. 33 refs., 26 figs.",not-nuke
Low Prandtl number magnetohydrodynamic natural convection in a strong cross field. The low Prandtl number flow of a conducting fluid about a semi-infinte vertical plate in the presence of a strong cross magnetic field is investigated numerically.

A numerical scheme is employed that takes advantage of the established limiting similarity states at the leading edge and downstream. 8 refs.,not-nuke
"Mechanical response of copper single crystals to corrosion - Fatigue in an aqueous oxide-forming environment. Oxide formation during fatigue was found to increases the rate of rapid hardening, and makes initial persistent slip band (PSB) formation more difficult than in air. Saturation was achieved more slowly, and the PSB volume fraction at saturation was lower than found in air, due to an interaction between the mode of deformation within PSBs and oxide deposition. This interaction made PSB formation progressively harder. It also caused a change in PSB morphology so that a homogeneous array of micro-PSBs was formed rather than distinct bands of macro-PSBs. The saturation stress was not affected, but the low PSB volume fraction caused increased local strains and, hence, reduced life.",not-nuke

"The Electrochemical Behavior of Alloy 22 in Extreme Chloride and Nitrate Environments. Alloy 22 specimens were tested in high temperature, high concentration chloride and nitrate environments. Results of this study indicate that increasing nitrate to chloride ratio in these electrolytes increases resistance to localized breakdown and mitigates repassivation. Open circuit (E{sub corr}), breakdown and repassivation potentials all increase, and localized corrosion morphology changes as nitrate to chloride ratio increases. Results also indicate that increasing the temperature increases E{sub corr} values, while breakdown potentials and repassivation potentials peak at 130 C for the highest nitrate to chloride ratio electrolytes.",nuke
"Quasiadiabatic continuation of quantum states: The stability of topological ground-state degeneracy and emergent gauge invariance. We define for quantum many-body systems a quasiadiabatic continuation of quantum states. The continuation is valid when the Hamiltonian has a gap, or else has a sufficiently small low-energy density of states, and thus is away from a quantum phase transition. This continuation takes local operators into local operators, while approximately preserving the ground-state expectation values. We apply this continuation to the problem of gauge theories coupled to matter, and propose the distinction of perimeter law versus 'zero law' to identify confinement. We also apply the continuation to local bosonic models with emergent gauge theories. We show that local gauge invariance is topological and cannot be broken by any local perturbations in the bosonic models in either continuous or discrete gauge groups. We show that the ground-state degeneracy in emergent discrete gauge theories is a robust property of the bosonic model, and we argue that the robustness of local gauge invariance in the continuous case protects the gapless gauge boson.",not-nuke
"HST PanCET Program: A Cloudy Atmosphere for the Promising JWST Target WASP-101b. We present results from the first observations of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Panchromatic Comparative Exoplanet Treasury program for WASP-101b, a highly inflated hot Jupiter and one of the community targets proposed for the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) Early Release Science (ERS) program. From a single HST Wide Field Camera 3 observation, we find that the near-infrared transmission spectrum of WASP-101b contains no significant H{sub 2}O absorption features and we rule out a clear atmosphere at 13 σ . Therefore, WASP-101b is not an optimum target for a JWST ERS program aimed at observing strong molecular transmission features. We compare WASP-101b to the well-studied and nearly identical hot Jupiter WASP-31b. These twin planets show similar temperature–pressure profiles and atmospheric features in the near-infrared. We suggest exoplanets in the same parameter space as WASP-101b and WASP-31b will also exhibit cloudy transmission spectral features. For future HST exoplanet studies, our analysis also suggests that a lower count limit needs to be exceeded per pixel on the detector in order to avoid unwanted instrumental systematics.",not-nuke

Calorimetry and density data on material from the four batches indicate homogeneity.",nuke
"The Y-located gonadoblastoma gene TSPY amplifies its own expression through a positive feedback loop in prostate cancer cells. Highlights: • Y-encoded proto-oncoprotein TSPY amplifies its expression level via a positive feedback loop. • TSPY binds to the chromatin/DNA at exon 1 of TSPY gene. • TSPY enhances the gene expression in a TSPY exon 1 sequence dependent manner. • The conserved SET/NAP-domain is essential for TSPY transactivation. • Insights on probable mechanisms on TSPY exacerbation on cancer development in men. - Abstract: The testis-specific protein Y-encoded (TSPY) is a repetitive gene located on the gonadoblastoma region of the Y chromosome, and has been considered to be the putative gene for this oncogenic locus on the male-only chromosome. It is expressed in spermatogonial cells and spermatocytes in normal human testis, but abundantly in gonadoblastoma, testicular germ cell tumors and a variety of somatic cancers, including melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. Various studies suggest that TSPY accelerates cell proliferation and growth, and promotes tumorigenesis. In this report, we show that TSPY could bind directly to the chromatin/DNA at exon 1 of its own gene, and greatly enhance the transcriptional activities of the endogenous gene in the LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Domain mapping analyses of TSPY have localized the critical and sufficient domain to the SET/NAP-domain. These results suggest that TSPY could efficiently amplify its expression and oncogenic functions through a positive feedback loop, and contribute to the overall tumorigenic processes when it is expressed in various human cancers.",not-nuke
Laboratory experiments in fracture propagation. This paper describes fracturing experiments in dry blocks of various rock materials. The results have application to evaluation of hydraulic fracturing theories. The block dimensions were 3 in. X 4 in. X 12 in. (7.6 cm X 10.2 cm X 30.5 cm) with metal plates epoxied to the 3-in. X 12-in. (7.6-cm X 30.5-cm) faces. Remaining faces were coated with soft epoxy to provide an impermeable jacket. The blocks were loaded in a pressure cell with an upper movable piston bearing on the 3-in. X 4-in. (7.6-cm X 10.2-cm) faces. A servocontrolled press applied constant stress to these faces higher than a lateral confining stress applied by oil pressure. Fractures were initiated by injection of various fluids into a small notch located on a center plane parallel to the 4-in. X 12-in. (10.2-cm X 30.5-cm) faces. Fracture growth along the same plane was assured by the stress conditions.,not-nuke

"Investigation of electron impact processes relevant to visible lasers. Semi-annual report, 1 September 1976--28 February 1977. During this contract period the noise background in the electron spectrometer has been reduced to an acceptable level. Two parallel efforts are currently underway to investigate and optimize metastable rare gas atom production. A glow discharge source has been constructed which produces on the order of 10/sup 8//cm/sup 3/ argon metastable atoms within the collision volume intercepted by the electron beam. Electron scattering experiments are currently underway using this source. In addition the ion current capabilities of a Duoplasmatron ion source are being explored with a view to potential application to a charge transfer source of metastable rare gas atoms.

"Successful treatment of autoimmune manifestations in MRL/l and MRL/n mice using total lymphoid irradiation (TLI). The autoimmune manifestations of MRL-+/+ (MRL/n) and MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr (MRL/l) murine models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were successfully reversed following total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) therapy consisting of 8-12 daily fractions of 200 rad. Following radiotherapy the characteristic lymphadenopathy of MRL/l disappeared, proteinuria was 334 mg% compared to a peak of 2272 mg% in untreated controls, and the median survival time was prolonged to 423 days compared to 214 days in untreated mice. The albuminuria of TLI-treated MRL/n mice was 194 mg% compared to 1180 mg% in untreated controls. The survival of treated MRL/n mice was prolonged to a median of 389 as compared to 190 days in untreated controls. The effect of TLI on antiDNA antibodies in both MRL/l and MRL/n was less remarkable. However, the antiDNA activity reached normal levels in most long-living mice. The most impressive finding was complete reversal and/or prevention of the SLE-like glomerulonephritis in MRL/l mice as documented by light and electron microscopy. Immunomanipulation with TLI should be further evaluated as a possible treatment modality in intractable human autoimmune disorders.",not-nuke

"Real-time optical characterization and control of heteroepitaxial Ga{sub x}In{sub 1{minus}x}P growth by P-polarized reflectance. The characterization and control of thin film growth processes requires improved methods of characterization and understanding of decomposition pathways and surface reaction kinetics under steady-state epitaxial growth involving organometallic precursors. In this contribution the authors present the application of p-polarized reflectance spectroscopy (PRS) for real-time monitoring and control of pulsed chemical beam epitaxy (PCBE) during low temperature growth of epitaxial Ga{sub 1{minus}x}In{sub x}P heterostructures on Si(001) substrates by PCBE, where the growth surface is sequentially exposed to organometallic precursors. During the pulsed precursor supply the surface reaction kinetics can be followed by analyzing a periodically in composition and thickness modulated surface reaction layer (SRL), which is captured in the PR-signals as a fine structure that is superimposed to the interference fringes caused due to the underlying growing film. The optical response is linked to the growth process via a reduced order surface kinetics (ROSK) model and integrated as a control signal in the implementation of filter and control algorithms for closed-loop controlled growth of epitaxial Ga{sub 1{minus}x}In{sub x}P heterostructures on Si(001) substrates. The control concept has been applied for thickness and compositional graded multi-heterostructure Ga{sub x}In{sub 1{minus}x}P epilayers and validated by ex-situ post-growth analysis, showing superior tracking of composition and thickness targets under closed loop controlled conditions compared to films grown using pre-designed source injection profiles (open-loop conditions).",not-nuke
